# Green Label Singapore
Green Label Singapore is a certification scheme that aims to promote sustainability and eco-friendliness in Singapore. Launched in 1992 by the Singapore Environment Council (SEC), the scheme has since grown to become a well-recognized and trusted symbol of environmental responsibility in the country.

## What is Green Label Singapore?

Green Label Singapore is a certification scheme that recognizes environmentally friendly products and services in the country. The scheme covers a wide range of categories, from household appliances and cleaning products to food and beverage, personal care, and even building materials.

To receive the Green Label certification, products and services must meet a set of environmental standards and criteria that have been established by the Singapore Environment Council. These standards cover areas such as resource conservation, waste reduction, and pollution control, among others.

## How does Green Label Singapore work?

To apply for the Green Label certification, companies must first submit an application form and pay a fee. Once the application is received, the product or service is evaluated by a panel of experts who assess its environmental impact and compliance with the Green Label standards.

If the product or service meets the criteria, it will be awarded the Green Label certification, which can be used for marketing and promotional purposes. The certification is valid for three years, after which the product or service must be re-evaluated to maintain its certification.
