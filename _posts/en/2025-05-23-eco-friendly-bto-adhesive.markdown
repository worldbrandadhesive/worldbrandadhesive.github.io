## Understanding the Formaldehyde Concern

A recent [Channel News Asia article](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/formaldehyde-wooden-furniture-homeowners-seeking-help-sick-4475181) highlighted the story of a family in Hougang whose children fell sick due to high formaldehyde emissions from newly installed wooden furniture. This situation exposed the hidden health risks in home renovation materials—specifically formaldehyde, a volatile organic compound (VOC) found in many adhesives and composite wood products.

## The Health Risks

Formaldehyde exposure can lead to:
- Respiratory issues
- Skin irritation
- Long-term carcinogenic risks

The NEA is currently studying regulations to limit formaldehyde emissions in household materials.
