# SGBC Green Mark
In a world where climate change and environmental degradation are increasingly pressing concerns, sustainable development has become a critical agenda for individuals, organizations, and governments worldwide. One of the ways in which this goal is being pursued is through certification schemes that recognize buildings and infrastructure that meet specific sustainability standards.

This article will explore what the SGBC Green Mark is, how it works, and why you should care about it.

# What is SGBC Green Mark?  
The SGBC Green Mark is a green building rating system established by the Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC) in 2005. It provides a framework for assessing and recognizing the environmental performance of buildings in Singapore. The scheme evaluates a building's environmental impact across various categories such as energy efficiency, water conservation, sustainable materials, indoor environmental quality, and operational performance. Based on its performance in these categories, a building can receive a Green Mark certification rating ranging from Certified to Platinum, with Platinum being the highest.

# How does SGBC Green Mark work?  
The SGBC Green Mark is a voluntary certification scheme that encourages sustainable design, construction, and operation of buildings in Singapore. The certification process involves a rigorous evaluation of a building's environmental performance by an independent third-party assessor. The assessor reviews a building's design, construction, and operational plans and provides recommendations for improvement where necessary. To achieve a Green Mark certification, a building must meet minimum requirements in certain categories and achieve a certain number of points overall. The categories and points required vary depending on the type and size of the building.
